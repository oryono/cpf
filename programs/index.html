        <h4>Food security for vulnerable people of Northern Uganda (FOSPU)</h4>
        <p>
            CPF successfully implemented a food security program in Amuru district; Food Security for Vulnerable People
            of Northern Uganda  (FOSPU) Project funded by ACDI/VOCA/ USAID targeting 1,500 households and 3000 small
            holders farmers who were supported to improve household productivity of Rice, Groundnut, Beans and cassava.
            This was done through provision of training in the following key technical areas to the project beneficiaries:
        </p>
        <p><b>Agronomy Technical Area:</b> Beneficiaries were trained on good agricultural practices such as early land
            preparation, early planting, seeds selection, correct spacing, pests and disease control and Demonstration
            farms were established to pass on knowledge to the farmer groups. One hundred demonstration plots were
            established, one in each of the groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Farming as a business (FaaB) Technical Area:</b> CPF trained the beneficiary groups in basic skills such as
            enterprise selection, record keeping, business management skills, and risk management. Each of the 100
            groups received a training of between 3 to 7 sessions in this section.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Post-harvest handling and marketing technical Area:</b> CPF trained 3000 beneficiaries in Post-harvest handling
            with respect to the target crops (Cassava, Rice, Beans and groundnuts). These 30 FEWs will in turn train the
            rest of the beneficiary farmers. Three hundred Demonstrations storage facilities (granaries) will be built,
            one in each group. These improved granaries will be constructed at homes of selected contact farmers as a
            way of encouraging others to replicate the practice in their households. The practical demonstrations of the
            construction of improved granaries will be done towards the beginning of the harvesting season.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Self-help Groups development Technical Area:</b> The project organizeD communities to work together in groups,
            access production inputs as groups and learn to address issues affecting them collectively. CPF trained the
            100 groups in savings mobilization, loans management, marketing as well other group dynamics. The groups were
            guided to agree on an amount of money that will be contributed by each member on a weekly basis to establish
            group savings. These served as revolving funds from where members accessed small loans to finance their activities.
            The households that benefited from the project later came together and formed Lamogi Farmers’ Cooperative Society Ltd.

                <h5>Girl-child Education Support Project (GESP)</h5>
                <p>
                    The Girl-child Education Support Project (GESP) is being implemented in Amuru district with support
                    from KNH. The project was initiated on the tenet that there still remains a big issue of big gender
                    gap in enrolment of girls compared to that of boys in primary schools in Amuru district and northern
                    Uganda in general.The project is therefore meant to reduce on this gender gap and increase girl child
                    enrolment in primary schools. It equally focuses on assisting girls who are ‘at risk’ of dropping out,
                    to remain in school while encouraging those who have dropped out to resume education. These gaps are
                    attributed to the two decades’ conflict that confine the population into internally displaced camps
                    rendering parents helpless in meeting the basic school needs for their children. As communities
                    resettle back to their original homes, schools are far from homes, sanitation and hygiene facilities
                    in schools are inadequate and poorly maintained.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project therefore aim at improving the quality of life and education of 3000 children in Amuru
                    district by 2015 and this would be achieved through 2 objectives namely; (i) improving enrolment and
                    retention of 1800 girl children (ii) increasing child rights awareness of 3000 children on issues
                    that affect them in schools and communities.A total of 3299 girls and 3309 boys are benefiting from
                    the project through children clubs, constructed latrines with changing rooms, participation in
                    designated activities such as essay writing competition, debates, development of IEC materials,
                    participation in Day of African Child and International Women’s day, poem citations, dances/songs
                    and drama performances and friendly football and netball matches between children clubs members.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An estimated 4500 children have also been reached through radio talk shows and sport jingles, out of
                    school outreaches, essay competition, community sensitization meetings with  parents on their roles
                    and roles of stake holders in education of children.

                    Shonglap means a dialogue held between the Animators and the adolescent girls in the centers among
                    the girls in order to ensure development of their living standards, mentally and economically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It started from Bangladesh in India where it was realized that the young girls do not know much
                    about life and how to live it. The main reasons for this are: they don’t have self-confidence, and
                    they do not know the different issues about their day to day lives. The most important issues among
                    these are; little knowledge about their rights as human beings and also people in the community and
                    do not know how to stay healthy and what food is good for health. On the other hand, there are few
                    chances of them getting work to earn money. Shonglap was introduced to remove all those and develop
                    the standard of living of the Adolescent girls.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project is working towards the development of the standard of living of the adolescent girls
                    through increasing awareness in life related issues, acquiring of knowledge/ literacy, professional
                    life skills with the view of making the young girls independent. It will be achieved through
                    the Shonglap centers established for the young adolescent girls in the project areas.

                Charity for Peace Foundation opened a night commuter’s center in Gulu in July 2003 with 7328 children.
                The number kept on reducing and because of the Peace process in Juba, Southern Sudan, and the number has
                reduced to 37 children. These children were still commuting for various reasons ranging from child headed
                families, total orphans, street children, lack of accommodation etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                With emergency one time funds from UNICEF and Save the Children, we were able to construct 4 halls as
                dormitory for the children. We also constructed office block where we are operating now.

            <p>
                In the year 2007, Action for Street Kids (ASK), UK came in and help us to start survey and follow up of
                children and the families they come from. We also managed to put the Care Givers of the children in a
                group of bead making as part of income generating activity. Mr. Peter Tyrer( African Children Fund, UK)
                visited Uganda in the Month of August and after analyzing the problem of the children, we agreed that the
                center will become re-habilitation centre for children. It will be called Temporal Residential Care for Orphans
                and Vulnerable Children of Northern Uganda(TRC). This center is now operational and helps to re-habilitate
                and reintegrate orphans, street children and other vulnerable children due to the war in northern Uganda.
                We re-integrate them in the community by empowering Care Givers and Mentors of these children in the community.

                    Every year children from the poor northern Districts of Uganda are duped by people from the relatively
                    richer parts of Uganda and beyond and taken as house helpers, baby sitters, sometimes as sex slaves
                    (workers) and sometime in the name of paying school fees for them. Most often, these are children below
                    15 years of age, who due to their vulnerable circumstances miss several opportunities to develop themselves
                    and to live with their relatives and other support systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Funded by National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI), the 4 months project at
                    $4000 enlisted the support of community and community leaders to sensitize the community against
                    allowing their children to be trafficked and wasted. The project created community structure which
                    is fighting child trafficking among the community
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project was just a beep in the community. When awareness was raised, community reported cases
                    which needed action but funding has never been raised to continue with sensitization and action to
                    support victims of child trafficking.
