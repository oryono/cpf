                    Charity for Peace Foundation has its genesis from three youthful Ugandans (Anthony Akol, Kidega James Nabinson and Mark Olwal ) at the time when Gulu was experiencing the climax of the northern Uganda insurgency in 2001. There was frequent abductions, mass killings and up hazard movement of night commuters with children estimated at 40,000 daily coming to town from villages to receive protection and avoid abduction. The organization was formed majorly to uplift the plight of children who roamed the streets at night, seeking accommodation, safety and security. These children were prone to risks of rape, sexual harassment, abduction and general hardships of hunger and cold. Education in the suburbs of town used to begin at 10:00 am and closed at 3:00 pm. The idea of forming the organization was to assist these night commuters live a better life. This thinking was sold to other individuals who later came together to form this charity organization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first step the organization took was to mobilize local resources to help set up a night commuter centre where the children would sleep in at night. This was successfully done as local support was overwhelmingly given and later supported by development partners like CPAR, UNICEF, Save the Children among others. CPF is now using this premise as her Head Office but paying monthly ground rent to Uganda Railways Corporation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    CPF has continued to work with communities to break the cycles of violence, hatred and despair by providing psychological, emotional and educational support to the survivors of conflict.  Our work enables these survivors to come to terms with their past experiences, make the most of their present and build a better future.

                    The northern districts of Uganda have been seriously affected by armed conflict and insurgency between Uganda People Defence Forces (UPDF) and the Lords’ Resistance Army (LRA) for over two decades. The region suffered socially, educationally, economically and developmentally as approximately 1.8 million1 people were force into internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. This created a large dependent population, confined to highly congested areas that were poorly   resourced and this caused a break down in social and administrative system, increased vulnerability to diseases, delinquency among the young population, increased incidence of human rights abuses and other poorly related manifestations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Following Juba Peace Talks that started in July 2006, the formally displaced persons started accessing their lands and homes in small numbers.  By December 2009, 85% of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) had already resettled in their original home and to date, Amuru district is in the final stage of its camp phase out1. Amid this transition period from violent to post conflict, very essential services such as clean water, health, education among others that would facilitate quick recovery and allow people to fully embark on rehabilitation and development of their area are either not there or inadequate .

                    The government of Uganda started implementing Universal Primary Education (UPE) in 1997 through the introduction of free primary education. Despite all commitments put, there still remains a gender gap with enrolments of girl children falling significantly behind that of their boys’ counterpart. This gap is particularly striking in the Northern region, which has the lowest school attendance rate in Uganda with 84.1% for boys and 80.6% for girls
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Uganda Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) highlights education as one of the key instruments for enhancing the quality of life of the poor in Uganda. Primary education enables grass-root members to earn higher incomes, enjoy better health and increased empowerment, especially among girls.
                </p>

                <p>
